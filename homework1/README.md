# Homework 1
Owen Kalbfleisch
## How to use
Inside DevEdu I ran the following inside the /homework1/tests dir:  
pytest test_task1.py  
pytest test_task2.py  
pytest test_task3.py  
pytest test_task4.py  
pytest test_task5.py  
pytest test_task6.py  
pytest test_task7.py  

All test pass and work, one thing that I had to do was run the following 2 cmds:  
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src  
pytest test_taskX.py  

I was also able to run them locally in VScode with no issues.
